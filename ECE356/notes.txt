OS structures

Monolithic structure - Traditional Uninx, Linux
everythig in one place
disadvantage of having everything in one block/system/etc:
- harder to read/comprehend
- debugging is difficult
- recompilation change

advantage of having everything in one block/system/etc:
- fast
- performant

Layered Approach - Android
divided into a numer of layers(levels)
disadvantage:
- slow performance
- difficulty in defining the functionality of each layers
advantages:
modularized code 
simpler debugging
isolation btween layers

Microkernels - Mach influenced Mac OS X's Darwin Kernel
minimal kernel Code: Moves as much from the kernel into user space
