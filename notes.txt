----------------------------------------------1. Introducing C------------------------------------------------

Developed in early 1970s at Bell labs. C is a by product of the
UNIX OS (Operating System), which was also developed at Bell labs.
Unix is written in Assembly. A high level programming language was 
needed for further development of Unix, and so the "B" programming
language was born. B was based on BCPL, and BCPL was based on Algol60.

ANSI (American National Standards Institute)
C89 is often referred to as ANSI C

C based language:
C++
Java is based on C++
C# is language derived from C++ and Java
Perl has adopted many features of C

---------------------------------------------------2. C Fundamentals-----------------------------------------------

Getting a C program to run requires the following steps:

1. Preprocesing: commands that begin with '#' are known as directives.
The preprocessor obeys these directives, and can add things to the
program and make modifications.
2. Compiling: the modified program goes to a compiler, which translates
it into machine instructions (object code).
3. Linking: a linker combines object code produced by the compiler with
any additional code needed to yield a complete executable program. This
additional code includes library functions (like printf()) that are used
in the program.

Command to compile programs:

gcc -o pun pun.c

gcc: is the compiler
-o: one of the options offered by cc, allows to chose the name of 
the file containing the executable program. 
pun: name of the file containing the exectuable program
pun.c: the file containing the source code

the source code for pun.c is given below:

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){

    printf("To C, or not to c: that is the question.\n");

    return 0;
}

General form of a simple program

directives
int main(void){
    statements
}

------Directives------
Before a C program is compile, it is first edited by a preprocessor.
Commands intended for the processor are called directives.
Directives do not end with a semicolon

example: #inlcude <stdio.hÈ›
contains information about C's standard I/O library

------Functions------
Functions are like "procedures" or "subroutines" in other programming
languages-they are the building blocks from which programs are 
constucted.

The statement "return 0;" has two effect:
1) causes the main function to terminate (ending the program)
2) indicates that the main function returns a value of 0.

------statements------
a statement is a command to be executed when the program runs.
a statement must end with a semicolon (except compound statements).
a semicolon shows he compiler where the statement ends.

------function call------
asking a function to perform its assigned task is know as calling the
function.

------string literal------
a series of characters enclosed in double quotation marks

------comments------
// this is a single line comment
/*this
is a 
multi-line
commnt
*/

most common style of commenting:
/*
* Name:
* Age:
* Date:
*/

------------Variables------------
A variable is basically a named storage location in memory that can
hold a value. You can store, change, and retrieve values from 
it while your program runs.

------Types------
Every variable must have a type, which specifies what kind of data it
will hold. Below are a few types:
int (integer), range: 32 bits. Holds Integers
float(floating-point), range: 32 bits. Holds Integers and decimal values.

------Declaration------
variables must be declared-described for the benefit of the compiler-
before they can be used. To declare a variable, the type of the variable,
then the its name. 

Examples:
int age;
float profit;
int age, number, length;
float profit, weight, width;

------assignments------
a variable can be given a value by means of assignment.

Example:
assigning values to int variables 
height = 8;
length = 12;
width = 11;
the numbers 8, 12, 10.5 are constants.

Example:
assigning decimal values to float variables 
weight = 10.5f;
length = 125.901f;
the letter "f" (for "float") is appended to a constant that conatins
a decimal point.


------------Printing the value of a variable------------
printf() can be used to display the current value of a variable.
certain placeholders are used to print values of different types.
The "f" in printf() stands for formatted.

Type    :   placeholder
int     :   %d
float   :   %f
Example:
int height = 10;
printf("Height: %d\n", height);

float weight = 72.50f;
printf("weight: %f", weight);
output: 72.500000 i.e 6 decimal digits

to control the number of digits after decimal point for float values,
put .p between '%' and 'f', where p is the number of decimal digits.
Example:
float weight = 72.50f;
printf("weight: %.2f", weight);
output: weight: 72.50

Example:
printing multiple variables
printf("age: %d\n height: %.2f\n", age, height);
output:
age: 22
height: 72.50

------------Reading input to a variable------------
scanf() can be used to obtain input from the user.
The "f" in scanf() stands for formatted, just like printf().

scanf("%d", &i);    //reads an integer value, stores into i
scanf("%f", &x);    //reads a float value, stores in x

------------Macro Definition------------
example: 
#define MAGIC_NUMBER 255

#define is a preprocessing directive, just like #include,
so no need for ";". The convention is to use upper-case
letters in macro names.

The value of a macro can also be an expression. 
Example:
#define RECIPROCAL_OF_PI (1.0f/3.14f)
To print a macro, use the appropriate placeholders.
Example:
printf("reciprocal of pie is: %f\n", RECIPROCAL_OF_PI);

------------Identifiers------------
Identifiers are names for variables, functions, macros,
and other entities. An identifier:
-may contain letters, digits, underscores
-MUST begin with a letter or underscore.

examples of legal identifiers:
times10     get_next_char   _done

examples of illegal identifiers:
10times     get-next-char

The convention is to use lowercase snake-case identifiers.
Examples:
full_name   last_name   new_age     new_height

There is NO limit on the maximum lenght of an identifier.

There are certain keywords which must NOT be used
as identifiers. They can be easily googled.

------------Layout of a C program------------
a C program can be seen as a series of tokens: a group of
characters that can't be split up without changing their meaning.

It is possible to put the entire main function on a single line,
if a page wide enough was available. However it is NOT possible to 
put the WHOLE building on line as each PREPROCESSING directive 
requires a separate line.

It is possible to insert any amount of space-blanks, tabs, new line
characters-between tokens. This has some important consequences:
- Statements can be divided over any number of lines
- Space between toekns makes it easier for the eye to separate them.
- Identation can make nesting easier to spot
- Blank lines can divide a program into logical units, making it easier
for the reader to understand the program's structure.

Compilation command to find the most errors:
gcc -o Wall -W -pedantic -asni -std=c99 -o pun.o pun.c
